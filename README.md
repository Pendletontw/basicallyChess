Hello! Hi! This is my engine!

To run this project, you must follow these instructions:

1st. Make sure you have node/npm 
2nd. When in the basicallyChess directory, run "npm install" and "npm run build"
3rd. Next run "npm run web"

This should create a Vite build that will be locally hosted

After that you should be able to play as either white or black against the engine. 

Note:
The engine will take a decent amount of time to make a move so please be patient.

I would suggest moving the pieces into a position that you want to test manually and then click the "Make Engine Move" button to see the engine's response.
